= Credit Risk

== Introduction

RAB is building a new credit risk system based on Neo4j that aggregates data from several sources

* CRM System
* Lending System 
* Credit rating agencies external data feed
* Market data external data feed

This system has a dashboard that helps credit analysts research companies and calculate *their credit risk score*. This score is based on company financials, performance forecast and credit agency ratings.

Data model of this solution stores data about

* Company assets
* Stock prices
* Commodity prices
* Credit ratings
* Forecasted earning
* Loans and their calculated risk scores

The time is January 2016. Letís see what the oil prices are

[source,cypher]
----
match path=(c:Commodity {name:'Brent Crude'})-[:LAST_COMMODITY_PRICE]->(p:CommodityPrice)-[:PREVIOUS_COMMODITY_PRICE*..]->(p2:CommodityPrice)
return path
----

The price is around 37 dollars for barrel



== Companies and Loans

Letís see the companies that we have in our database and their assets

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company)
return co.name, co.sharesOutstanding
----

And now letís look at Boreal Engineering, its assets

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"})-[:OWNS]->(a:Assets),
(co)-[:ISSUED]->(s:Stock)-[:LAST_PRICE]->(p:StockPrice)
return co.name, a.cashValue, a.stockValue, p.price, co.sharesOutstanding
----

its stock price


[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"})-[:OWNS]->(a:Assets),
(co)-[:ISSUED]->(s:Stock)-[:LAST_STOCK_PRICE]->(p:StockPrice)
return co.name, a.cashValue, a.stockValue, p.price, co.sharesOutstanding
----

its loan from RAB and the risk score RAB has assigned to this loan

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"}) <- [b:BORROWER] - (l:Loan) - [:LAST_RISK_SCORE] -> (rs:RiskScore)
return co, l, rs
----

1 is 100% which the best risk score possible.

Letís also check Boreal payment potential, which is based on the assets that it owns and its earnings forecast.

We will set it first for both loans that we have in our demo. Neo4j is schema-on-read database and it will let us do this. Note that we store this value on the BORROWER relationship itself

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"}) <- [b:BORROWER] - (l:Loan)
set b.paymentPotential=42.717
----

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Hull Staffing Solutions"}) <- [b:BORROWER] - (l:Loan)
set b.paymentPotential=11.5
----

Letís verify it is there

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"}) <- [b:BORROWER] - (l:Loan)
return co.name, b.paymentPotential
----

Boreal payment potential is 42.717 M which is more than the remaining payment on the loan 42.4 M.

Last letís check Boreal credit rating

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"}) - [b:LAST_CREDIT_RATING] -> (cr:CreditRating)
return co.name, cr.rating
----

It is Aaa, best possible

== STEP 1 Oil price drops

Now a credit event happens ñ oil price drops. Letís simulate it and create a new node in time series

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Commodity {name:"Brent Crude"})-[ol:LAST_COMMODITY_PRICE]->(cpo:CommodityPrice)
create (cpo)<-[np:PREVIOUS_COMMODITY_PRICE]-(cpn:CommodityPrice {date:"20160106", price:29.00})<-[nl:LAST_COMMODITY_PRICE]-(co)
delete ol
return co, cpn, cpo 
----

Letís check the new time series

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Commodity {name:"Brent Crude"})
match (cp:CommodityPrice)
return co, cp 
----

Next we will explore the effects of this event

== STEP 2 Impact to Heritage Energy

Heritage Energy stock price drops from 42.35 to 20.00
[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Heritage Energy"})-[:ISSUED]->(s:Stock)-[:LAST_STOCK_PRICE]->(sp:StockPrice)
return co, s, sp
----

As the result RAB analysts downgrade their earnings forecast from 6 M
[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Heritage Energy"})-[:LAST_FORECAST]->(f:Forecast)
return co, f
----

to 2.8 M
[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Heritage Energy"})-[:LAST_FORECAST]->(f:Forecast)
set f.earningsPerShare = 0.35
set f.earnings = 2.8
return co, f
----

The analyst took this action because credit risk system dashboard notified him that performance and valuation of Heritage Energy is dependent on the oil prices

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company) - [:DEPENDS] -> (com:Commodity)
return co, com
----


== STEP 3 Impact to companies connected to Heritage Energy

Heritage Energy stock price drop

Credit risk system dashboard alerts RAB analyst to review all companies associated with Heritage Energy (HEN)

[source,cypher]
----
match (co1) - [:CONTRACTED] -> (co2:Company)
return co1, co2
----

RAB analyst lowers the earnings forecast of Boreal Engineering (BOR) based on the fact that it has a large contract to develop Alberta oil sands with HEN. (letís check the values before the change)

Letís check the values first
[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"})-[:LAST_FORECAST]->(f:Forecast),
(co)<-[b:BORROWER]-(l:Loan),
(co)-[:OWNS]-(a:Assets)
return co, f, b, l, a
----

And then apply RAB analyst updates

[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"})-[:LAST_FORECAST]->(f:Forecast)
set f.earningsPerShare = 0.12
set f.earnings = 2.215
return co, f
----

This will result in a systematic update of BOR payment potential for the loan that it has with RAB.

The payment potential is basically the sum of all assets plus the sum of projected earnings for the remaining term of the loan. Remember its value was 42.717 which is enough to pay off the loan of 42.4 M. Now it should go down to 33.858 because BOR earnings forecast was lowered from 4.429 M to 2.215 M. Loan term is 4 years. And BOR total assets stayed the same at 25 M


[source,cypher]
----
match (co:Company {name:"Boreal Engineering"})-[:LAST_FORECAST]->(f:Forecast),
(co)<-[b:BORROWER]-(l:Loan),
(co)-[:OWNS]-(a:Assets)
set b.paymentPotential = a.totalValue + f.earnings * l.loanTerm
return b.paymentPotential
----

This change in tern impacts performance score calculated by the credit risk system. It goes down form 100 percent to 79.9 percent. And the overall risk score, which is comprised of performance score and the agency score goes down from 100 to 79.9 as well. (Both scores were 100 before)



== STEP 4 Impact to Boreal Engineering stock assets

Rockies Rail stock fell from 8.48 to 2.75. As the result the value of Boreal engineering assets went down from 25 M to 12 M. As the result performance score is systematically downgraded from 79.9 percent to 49.2 percent.

The rating agency also downgraded BOR from Aaa to A. As the result its agency score fell from 100 percent to 80 percent.

Overall credit risk score is a combination of performance score and agency score. It fell from 79.9 percent to 39.4 percent


== STEP 5 Impact to companies that have contracts with Boreal Engineering and Heritage Energy

Analyst looks at Hull Staffing Solutions (HSS) based on connected data displayed by Credit Risk System dashboard. Analyst learns that HSS has significant number of staff working on Alberta oil sands project with BOR and lowers earnings forecast for HSS.

Analysts predicts that since ARC has a contract with HEN, the refinery will have idle capacity. Therefore Analyst lowers earnings forecast for ARC. Market reacts as well, and both HSS and ARC stock price fall


== STEP 6 Forced contract termination between Boreal Engineering and Hull Staffing Solution leads to depletion of assets of both companies 

BOR stock falls as it announces restricting as a result of oil price drop. BOR terminates its contract with HSS and has to pay a termination fee in cash. The value of BOR's assets goes down further. As a result of BOR contract termination, HSS is forced to start  spending its cash assets in order to finance its operations.

The same holds true for ROC as they are loosing money


== STEP 7 Credit rating agencies react. As predicted by RAB analysts, loans with BOR and HSS are at risk

Analyst revises earnings forecasts for both BOR and HSS based on public information about companies being restructured. This makes credit risk score for both companies to go down even further. The share prices for both BOR and HSS also go down
